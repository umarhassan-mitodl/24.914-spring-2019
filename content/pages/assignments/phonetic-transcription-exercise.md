Due session 4

1\. Transcribe the sentences in the following sound files:

*   Recording at {{% resource_link "381e5186-c651-43cf-9e6d-7b8e94a8e9fc" "www.dialectsarchive.com/scotland-5" %}}, 1:03 to 1:05 (speaker from South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland)
*   speaker32.wav (from Michigan, I think) \[not available for OCW use\]
*   Recording at {{% resource_link "561bbb3a-5eb9-4981-a05b-4789b74ace10" "www.dialectsarchive.com/texas-1" %}}, 2:01 to 2:07 (from San Marcos, Texas)

2\. The Texan speaker in the recording at {{% resource_link "561bbb3a-5eb9-4981-a05b-4789b74ace10" "www.dialectsarchive.com/texas-1" %}} 0:06 to 1:05 uses two allophones of the /ɪ/ phoneme (the vowel in words like ‘this’, ‘it’, etc). Transcribe these two allophones. Do you think this is free variation or could it be conditioned variation? Explain why. If you think it might be conditioned variation, suggest a hypothesis about the conditioning factors.

People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
